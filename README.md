## Introduction

Holidaze is a project to showcase the development capabilities, visual design and technical skills over the past two years. Holidaze, a newly launched accommodation booking site, has approached us to develop a brand new front end for their application.

In this project, we will be working with the official API documentation provided by Holidaze to plan, design, and build a modern front-end accommodation booking application. The goal is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing application that allows users to book holidays at various venues and provides an admin-facing interface for managing venues and bookings.
